The world wasn’t built for kindness. Not in the way people like to pretend it is. You could spend a lifetime building walls, carving cities out of the wild, pouring everything you had into a legacy. But the world doesn’t care. It will still grind it all to dust when it’s ready. That was the lesson humanity learned when the Others came.

They say there was a golden age before it all fell apart. A time when men’s empires stretched from one corner of the earth to the other, rivers were tamed to carry their trade, and cities rose like monuments to ambition. It sounds like a story now. Something too big to be true. These days, all that’s left are ruins, and the only monuments you’ll find are the blackened husks of towers that burned long ago.

The Others came like a wave. No one agrees where they came from. Some say the gods sent them—punishment for man’s arrogance. Others whisper that they were summoned by mistake, something from the old world better left forgotten. Whatever the truth, it doesn’t change what they did. The world broke when they arrived, and no one’s put it back together since.

Elves came first, beautiful and cruel. Their mana cores burned bright as they rained fire and destruction on everything man had built. Orcs followed, smashing through the remains with brute strength, tearing down anything still standing. The dwarves stayed in their mountains but brought war engines with them—machines that shattered walls and cities alike. And in the shadows, the vampires waited, preying on the weak and the wounded like wolves circling a dying animal.

Rome burned. Constantinople crumbled. Greece? It didn’t even get the chance to fall in a blaze of glory. The proud descendants of Alexander were reduced to scattered tribes wielding shields and spears no better than the ones their ancestors had used centuries ago.

But the Others didn’t rule through brute force alone. Mana wells erupted across the land, reshaping life itself. The races with mana cores—elves, orcs, even goblins—grew stronger with each passing year. Humans, though? They had no cores. They could fight, train, and bleed, but they would always be weaker, slower, more fragile. The new world didn’t belong to them anymore.

Still, people whispered of the Marked. Humans chosen by the gods or fate to rise above, to reclaim what was lost. Some believed the stories. Most didn’t. But in a world as broken as this, even lies have their uses.

The first thing Hadrian noticed when he woke was the smell. Blood, thick and metallic, clung to the air, so strong it made his stomach twist. He opened his eyes slowly, his head pounding, his vision blurred. The ground beneath him was wet with mud and something darker—something that stained his hands red when he pushed himself up.

The battlefield stretched out around him, a scene of chaos and death. Men screamed, their cries sharp and desperate, as the clash of steel rang out against the guttural roars of orcs. The air was thick with smoke, making it hard to breathe, harder still to think.

Not far away, the remnants of the Macedonian phalanx fought on, though their formation was crumbling. Bronze shields locked together in a desperate attempt to hold back the tide, but the orcs were relentless. They crashed into the line like a battering ram, their iron weapons smashing through wood and flesh alike.

“Hold the line!” someone shouted, a voice raw with exhaustion.

Hadrian turned his head and saw him—a grizzled warrior at the center of the line, his shield cracked and his spear splintered. Blood streaked his face, but he didn’t falter. His spear lashed out, catching an orc in the throat. The creature fell, choking on its own blood, but another took its place almost immediately.

Hadrian’s hands fumbled in the dirt. They found the hilt of a sword, cold and slick with blood. It felt heavy in his hands, too heavy for a boy of eleven. But he held it anyway, his fingers tightening around the grip. What else could he do?

The orcs were everywhere, hulking and brutal, their tusks glinting in the weak sunlight. One of them swung a massive axe, splitting a man’s shield—and the arm behind it—in a single blow. Another drove its blade through a soldier’s chest, lifting him off the ground before tossing him aside like a broken doll.

Hadrian wanted to run. His legs trembled, his breath coming fast and shallow. He looked to the edge of the battlefield and saw it—a narrow gap between the chaos. He could slip away, disappear into the hills, and no one would even notice.

But his gaze caught on the grizzled warrior again. The man’s spear was gone now, replaced by a jagged length of wood. He drove it into an orc’s gut, but another blade found his side. The warrior staggered, blood pouring from the wound, but he didn’t fall.

“Hold the—!” The words cut off as the axe came down.

Hadrian froze. His hands shook, the sword trembling in his grip. He wanted to run. Every instinct screamed at him to flee, to get as far away from this nightmare as possible. But something stopped him. Something heavy, like a weight pressing on his chest.

If I run, who will remember him?

The thought burned in his mind. He gripped the sword tighter, forcing his feet to move. He swung wildly at the nearest orc, the blade catching its leg. It wasn’t enough to bring it down, but it was enough to make it notice him. The creature turned, its yellow eyes narrowing as it raised its axe.

“Run, boy!” a voice shouted.

Hadrian barely registered the old man with the scythe before he was shoved backward. The villager swung the rusted blade, catching the orc in the side. It wasn’t enough. The orc roared and brought its axe down. Hadrian turned away before he could see the rest.

The tide of orcs surged forward, sweeping him along like a piece of driftwood caught in a storm.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Hadrian woke again, the battlefield was gone. He was in a cart, his wrists bound with coarse rope that bit into his skin. Around him, other captives sat slumped in silence, their faces pale and hollow.

The countryside they passed through was scarred, blackened fields stretching as far as the eye could see. The smell of smoke lingered, a reminder of what had been lost.

Hadrian kept his head down, his thoughts churning. The grizzled warrior. The old man. Their faces wouldn’t leave him.

By the time they reached the orc camp, Hadrian’s body was weak, but his mind burned with something he couldn’t quite name.
